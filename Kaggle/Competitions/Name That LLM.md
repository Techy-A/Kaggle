# Name That LLM: which of 18 models wrote this paragraph?

Back to [[Kaggle Home]]. Code in the repo: `name-that-llm/`. Team: with Kino Lutor (merge separately per competition).

## Data
- train: 2,699 passages = 150 prompts x 18 models (exactly one per model per prompt); 36–274 words.
- test: ~4,000 passages on **unseen prompts**; per-model counts are unequal and the mix differs between public and private.

## Leaderboard history
| Date | Run | CV (prompt-grouped 5-fold) | Public LB |
|---|---|---|---|
| 15 Oct | TF-IDF char 1–5 + word 1–2, logistic regression | 0.342 | **0.345** |
| 15 Oct | + prompt-group Hungarian assignment (one model per prompt) | 0.433 | 0.335 |
| 15–16 Oct | Kino: name-that-llm-v5 (6 versions) | – | 0.461–0.492 |
| 16 Oct | Kino: exact copy of lightningv08 0.531 Qwen-LoRA ensemble (pinned env) | – | 0.532 (rank 110/735) |
| 17 Oct | Us: exact pinned copy of zbigniewkirchner/ntl-v6 | – | **0.552** (rank 33/1,032, silver zone) |

## Lessons
- **Prompt-grouped CV tracks the LB for the classifier** (0.342 vs 0.345). Trust it.
- **The one-per-model-per-prompt assignment does NOT transfer** (−0.010 on the LB): the test doesn't keep that structure. #lb-proven
- LB on day 2: top 0.531, #10 0.499, #100 0.460.

## Next
- 16 Oct: public best is **0.541** (`lightningv08/0-541-lora-adaptive-centering`, Qwen3 8B/4B + Qwen2.5 7B LoRA + encoder kernels, same pinned image `2757e0...`). An exact copy puts us around rank ~77: inside bronze (top 100 for 250–999 teams). Silver (top 50) needs **> 0.541**, because 65 teams are tied at 0.541 and ties go to the earlier submission.
- Fine-tune a small transformer (DeBERTa-v3 / ModernBERT) on GPU; ensemble with TF-IDF.

## 17 Oct
- Public notebooks moved overnight: zbigniewkirchner/ntl-v6 **0.552**, lightningv08 0-551 (TabPFN), kirilltym 0.550, lucasboesen 0.549. The planned 0.541 copy is obsolete.
- Built an exact pinned copy of ntl-v6 (aryanawasthiteykik/ntl-0-552-pinned-copy, image 2757e0..., all inputs public; uses the public Claude-API passages dataset, which the rules allow as free public external data). Pushed from our account after the weekly GPU quota reset. A watcher submits it once with `submission.parquet` when the run completes.
- Its trick: a third Qwen3-8B LoRA with a 5-way within-Claude head, plus "Claude gates" (when the blend predicts a Claude model, Claude-only models choose which one).

- **17 Oct: 0.552 copy scored 0.552, rank 33 of 1,032.** With more than 1,000 teams the medal lines are percentages: bronze top 10% (rank 103, 0.547 now), silver top 5% (rank 51, 0.550 now), gold top 12 (0.555 now). 14 teams are above us and 23 are tied at 0.552.

## 17 Oct night: merge experiment
- zbigniewkirchner ntl-v6 (0.552) and lightningv08 0-551 (0.551) both extend Lucas v3 (0.549) with non-overlapping additions:
  - zb: lora3 (Qwen3-8B LoRA with a Claude head) plus within-Claude gates, about 50 lines;
  - lv: v3 run as a script, then a TabPFN complement (0.1 weight) and punctuation rules.
- The merge (`aryanawasthiteykik/ntl-merge-tabpfn-claude-gates`, built by name-that-llm/merge/build_merge.py):
  - lv shell, with lucas_reference.py replaced by the zb main code;
  - the zb code saves its Claude-gate scores;
  - the gate is re-applied last, after the TabPFN mix and punctuation rules.
- Datasets are the union of both (all public).
- Submitted once when its run completes (the user asked for a few NTL submissions).
- Hoped-for result: the two gains stack, about +0.002–0.004, which would be the silver line (0.554).
- Note: Lucas's own latest version already adds family gates and more proxy-generation datasets. Its score is unknown (bestPublicScore is still 0.549).
